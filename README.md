# Chad's Manager Readme

## My role as tech lead

I'm here to help the team be as successful as possible. That means removing blockers along our critical path so we can branch out in parallel.

Sometimes that is interfacing with other teams, sometimes that is researching technical requirements, sometimes that is giving feedback to keep our code well organized.


##Feedback

I love feedback both positive and negative, good teams have honest constructive communication. Anonymous feedback is fine but please encrypt it client side using my public RSA key if it contains anything sensitive and put ANONYMOUS FEEDBACK in the header so I don't ignore it as SPAM. 

```bash
openssl rsautl -encrypt -pubin -inkey chads_key.pem.pub -ssl -in myMessage.txt -out myEncryptedMessage.txt
```
I especially crave feedback on how well our team is providing business value. The (business model canvas)[https://strategyzer.com/canvas/business-model-canvas] is a tool I find helpful for this.  




## Schedule
I try to be in the office from 9am to 5pm CST. I try to keep conflicts outside of 10am to 3pm CST.


## One-on-ones
I've had some managers that were effective in their one-on-one, some less so and I have tried to learn from that. I strive for 30 minutes once a week on all my direct reports, and let me know if we need to block off longer. 

On the issue of personal growth there is no best path. Reading a book, having a side project, presenting at a local user group, or taking a course are all great options. It doesn't have to be software. Leadership mentoring, coaching your child's sports team, design, woodworking; I want to help you have success at the creative endeavors you are passionate about learning.

## Work-life balance
Everyone needs eight hours sleep. School field trips, letting your pet out before 5pm, being sick or helping a sick family member...  If you roll in at 10am I will assume you are taking care of yourself or a family member. Please give me a heads up if you have a conflict between 10am and 3pm CST.   

## Performance

## If you need something

The number one point of contact is version control. Tag me, commit a failing unit test.  

Feel free to grab me at my desk. Fair warning, I am hard of hearing some days (fluid in my inner ear). I may suggest we use Slack or voice chat (headphones) if we can't speak up. Tell me if you are uncomfortable using a louder voice. Along those lines, tell me if you need any accommodations.   

I'm meeting resistant if there isn't a defined problem. Spending months drafting a Bezos 6-page memo may be overkill, but taking the time to draft at least a page or two helps everyone focus.

Also, I love to grab lunch. This is probably the best way to reach me if we have sparse interaction in the organization.
